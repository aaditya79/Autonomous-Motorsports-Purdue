# haar_cascade.py

Classification rules help to differentiate between the background pixels and object pixels. 
The Haar Cascade (feature based classifiers) pre-trained OpenCV file will be used to implement cascading windows.

# image_norm1.py

The first model normalizes a color image with min-max normalization and range [0,1]. 

# image_norm2.py

The second model normalizes a color image with binary output values of 0 or 1.

# neural_network.py

Programmed a neural network that predicts the value of output based on pre-trained input and output tables. 
The difference between the neuronâ€™s predicted and expected output is calculated and passed through the 
error derivative formula and Sigmoid function 20,000 times to determine an output value. 

Example:

Pre-trained Inputs: [0,0,0], [1,1,1], [1,0,0], [0,1,1]
Pre-trained Outputs: [0, 1, 0, 1]
Classification Rule: The second element in the pre-trained input is the output. 
User Input: [0,1,0]
Expected Output: [1]
Actual Output: [0.99490848]
